                Among various life-threatening diseases, heart disease has garnered a great deal of attention in medical research. The diagnosis of heart disease is a challenging task, which can offer automated prediction about the heart condition of patient so that further treatment can be made effective. The diagnosis of heart disease is usually based on signs, symptoms and physical examination of the patient. There are several factors that increase the risk of heart disease, such as smoking habit, body cholesterol level, family history of heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and lack of physical exercise.

                Heart is the most essential or crucial portion of our body. Heart is used to maintain and conjugate blood in our body. There are a lot of cases in the world related to heart diseases. People are leading to death due to heart disease. Various symptoms like chest pain, fasting of heartbeat and so on are mentioned. The health care industries found a large amount of data. This paper gives the idea of predicting heart disease using machine learning algorithms. Here, we will use various machine learning algorithms such as support vector classifier, random forest, knn, na√Øve bayes, decision tree and logistic regression. The algorithms are used on the basis of features and for predicting the heart disease. This paper uses different machine learning algorithms for comparing the accuracy among them.
